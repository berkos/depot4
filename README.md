It's about a store that sells e-books(only the cart process is made up). 
As a user you can add to your cart some of the books,AJAX technology is used so there is no need for the page to refresh.After that the user proceeds to checkout where he has to enter his details so he can place an order. After that mailers are used so the user receives automatically an e-mail that his order has been placed.
As an ADMIN a user can access full privilages under /admin where using the "Log in" system he can accees the "Orders" Section where there are the details of users who placed an order, "Users" section where he can add or delete any user, "Products" where he can add some new products , edit or remove the existing ones. E-store supports both English and Greek navigation.
